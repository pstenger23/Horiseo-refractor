# Code Refraction

Horision Search Engine Optimization

Welcome to Horiseon's Home Page! I was required to truly optimize
Horiseon's homepage. This process involved consolidation and cleaningup 
both the HTML and the CSS, as well as fixing a few bugs within the code. 
Now you will find a homepage that is optimized and accessible for 
everybody who wants to.
